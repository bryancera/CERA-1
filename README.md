# CERA-1
CERA-1, the Clay-Extruding Robotic Assistant

The CERA-1 is a mechanical paste extruder and 3D printer framework developed for ceramic 3D printing. 
It was designed as a modification to existing 3D printer or CNC frameworks.

In partnership with Amaco/Brent and Duet3D, CERA-1 is being redesigned, documented and published as an 
open-source hardware project. An earlier prototype is available at thingiverse.com, as well as at 
openprojects.bryancera.com. 

CERA-1 systems have been utilized world-wide by artists, designers and researchers in tandem with research 
in contemporary craft, digital fabrication and architecture.
